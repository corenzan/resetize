# Resetize.css

> An opinionated CSS reset.

## Rese.. what ?

The stylesheet extends from [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) &mdash; version 3.0.2 &mdash; with a twist: resets.

## Why, jus.. why ?

I like it this way. That's how I've been writing my CSS for some time now, I just extracted the common parts and exported into this project. Maybe it'll suit your needs, maybe it won't. Give it a try and tell me how it goes, will you ?

## I have few ideas of my own...

Great! Let me know what you think, what are your findings and what makes it easier for you to write your CSS. Go open an issue and propose some changes, I'd love to hear from you!
