# Resetize.css

> An opinionated CSS reset.

## About

The stylesheet extends from [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) version 6, then adds some resets:

- Remove bullets from (un)ordered lists.
- Remove paddings and margins.
- Set `box-sizing` of all elements to `inherit` and set root's to `border-box`.
- Remove input ornaments (number spinner, search clear button, etc).
