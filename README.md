# Resetize

> An opinionated CSS reset.

## About

**Resetize.css** extends [sanitize.css](https://github.com/csstools/sanitize.css) resetting most styles and leaving just a few opinionated defaults.

The goal is to add as few properties as possible when styling elements, specially form controls, and avoid wasting time fighting spaces, colors and sizes that come from browser defaults.
